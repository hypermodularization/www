1. Relevance to design: Designers often work with modular systems and components. The concept of modularity is well-established in design fields (e.g., modular design, modular typography, modular layouts).

2. Ease of use: It's shorter and rolls off the tongue more easily, which is beneficial for branding and word-of-mouth marketing.

3. Broader application: "Modularity" as a concept can encompass both the state of being modular and the process of creating modular systems, giving more flexibility in how discuss and apply the concept.

4. Aesthetic appeal: In the context of design, "modularity" has a more elegant and design-oriented feel compared to the more technical-sounding "modularization".

5. Memorability: The shorter term is likely to be more memorable for audience.
